## Parameters

| Parameter     | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|:--------------|:---------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `accessgrant` | yes | Your Access Grant which will be used to access Storj network. |
| `bucket`  | yes | The bucket name in which you want to store the registry's data. |

`accessgrant`: An Access Grant is a security envelope that contains a satellite address, a restricted API Key, and a set of one or more restricted prefix-based encryption keysâ€”everything an application needs to locate an object on the network, access that object, and decrypt it.

`bucket`: The name of your Storj bucket where you wish to store objects. The bucket must exist prior to the driver initialization.
